# 🔢 2048 Game in C

A simple terminal-based version of the 2048 game written in pure C. This project is a great exercise in logic, matrix manipulation, and terminal-based game loops.

## 🎮 Features

- Classic 2048 mechanics with arrow key controls
- 4x4 grid implementation using 2D arrays
- Merging logic and score calculation
- Terminal-based interface
- No external libraries required

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C (C99)
- GCC

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── program.c      # Main game logic and loop
├── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Compile the project**:
   ```bash
   gcc program.c -o 2048
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   ./2048
   ```

> Use arrow keys to play. The objective is to combine numbers to reach 2048.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
